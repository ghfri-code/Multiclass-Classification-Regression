Dataset : Iris https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris

In this part we use iris dataset for multiclass classification(one-vs.-one and one-vs.-all) by logistic regression. Then using softmax regression and compare them. Consider the first 80% of the data in each class for train and the rest 20% for test.

Plot cost function for enough iteration for one-vs-all method:

![type2](https://github.com/Ghafarian-code/Multiclass-Classification-Regression/blob/main/LogisticRegression/OneVSall/images/Figure_3.png)

What method (one-vs.-one, one-vs.-all or softmax) has worked best?
